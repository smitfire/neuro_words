Abstract
Background: Somatic Marker Hypothesis (SMH), based on clinical observations, delineates
neuronal networks for interpreting consciousness generation and decision-making. The Iowa
gambling task (IGT) was designed to verify the SMH. However, more and more behavioral and
brain imaging studies had reported incongruent results that pinpointed a need to re-evaluate the
central representations of SMH. The current study used event-related fMRI (functional Magnetic
Resonance Imaging) to examine neural correlates of anticipation vs. outcome, wins vs. losses, and
differential decks' contingencies of IGT.
Results: Behavioral results showed a prominent effect of frequency in driving choices. The insula
and basal ganglia were activated during the anticipation phase while the inferior parietal lobule was
activated during the outcome phase. The activation of medial prefrontal cortex was especially
targeted during the high punishment contingencies. The data suggest that under uncertainty the
normal decision makers can become myopic.
Conclusion: The insula and basal ganglia might play a vital role in long-term guidance of decisionmaking. Inferior parietal lobule might participate in evaluating the consequence and medial
prefrontal cortex may service the function of error monitoring.

Background
Damasio et al. proposed the Somatic Marker Hypothesis
(SMH) to interpret the function of the medial prefrontal
cortex (MPFC) [1-4]. Earlier neurological studies by
Damasio et al. indicated that the MPFC plays an important role in integrating the bodily signals (Somatic
Marker), which provide emotional representation of different external events. In another words, normal decision
makers with intact MPFC can integrate the bodily signals

implicitly and automatically make advantageous real-life
decisions, particularly regarding uncertain events which
cannot be logically inferred. This is supported by clinical
observations that the MPFC patients who retain normal
IQ score may still encounter problems in making real-life
decisions.
Notably, a growing body of behavioral and theoretical
studies of the IGT had pinpointed some possible con-

founds that may result in misinterpretation of the SMH
[5-11]. Some IGT studies suggested that decision-makers
may actually preferred bad final-outcome deck B to good
final-outcome deck C. Lin and Chiu et al. [6,7] termed this
phenomenon as "prominent deck B". Wilder et al. [9],
MacPherson et al. [12], Maia and McClelland [8] and
Rodríguez-Sa'nchez et al. [13] also mentioned that normal
decision-makers may be guided by gain-loss frequency
rather than final outcome.
According to neurological studies by Iowa group, Bechara
and Damasio [14,15] defined additional brain regions for
the neuronal network of SMH. Two loops have been postulated: the "Body Loop" and the "As-if Body Loop". The
neural substrates of both loops include the MPFC, amygdala, insular cortex (IN), somatosensory cortex (S1), and
brainstem nuclei [14]. They suggested that these brain
regions constitute the central representation of the
somatic signal processing in generating the advantageous
decisions. Recently, the Iowa group had enlisted the striatum, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) to extend the neuronal loops of
SMH [15].
However, some neuroscientists [5,10,11] pointed out the
theoretical flaws of these loops for SMH, e.g., there being
little neurological (lesion) evidence of S1 involvement for
the SMH [5]. An increasing number of studies demonstrated that deficits of proposed somatic loops do not necessarily affect IGT performance [9,16-21]. Many IGT
related studies [9,16-21] provided data incongruent with
the proposed neuronal correlates for SMH. Dunn, et al.
[22], after thoroughly reviewing the SMH and IGT-related
behavioral, physiological, lesion, and brain imaging studies, reported the diversity of the results [23-30] (see also
Table 1). The imaging studies revealed that except the
MPFC, regions as the anterior cingulate cortex and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) were highly involved in
decision-making processing during IGT, but were not
included from the proposed main loops by the Iowa
group [14]. The S1 was not activated except in two studies
[23,25]. One major limitation is that these IGT brain
imaging studies only investigated the central representations for the risk vs. safe or good vs. bad decks. Furthermore, most IGT brain imaging studies focused only on the
MPFC or orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) but did not discuss
other regions associated with probability learning [31,32]
for decision making under uncertainty.
It is noteworthy that the aforementioned studies did not
investigate the critical dimensions of "anticipation" and
"experience" of the decision making, respectively, to elucidate the complexity of the IGT-brain processing. Knutson et al. [33] observed that anticipation of reward and the
actual fulfillment of outcome may involve different brain

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2202/9/72

circuitries. During reward anticipation the nuclear
accumbens was involved while during outcome experience the MPFC was activated. Moreover, Breiter et al. [34],
using a gambling task comprising both monetary reward
and punishment, demonstrated that anticipation and
experience of monetary gains and losses may have different central representations.
In this study, the event-related fMRI (functional Magnetic
Resonance Imaging) was exploited to monitor brain activity associated with gain-loss frequency and final outcome,
respectively. Brain activity during anticipation (decision
driving) and experience (value representation) were deciphered to elucidate the neuronal architectures for the two
dimensions in the decision making processing. Detailed
analyses of anticipation and experience of gain, loss and
draw were conducted. Four choices (2 good and 2 bad
final-outcome decks) and the hierarchical changes of
value in IGT were detailed to track the reactive brain
responses. According to the findings obtained by Wilder et
al. [8,9,12,13,18,35-40], normal decision makers should
prefer decks B and D (high-frequency gains decks) over
decks A and C (low-frequency gains decks). The lentiform
nucleus (LN, basal ganglia) should be targeted to deal
with probability information processing [41]. If the SMH
holds, then the MPFC is expected to be activated for the
integration of somatic markers for decision making under
uncertainty.

Results
Behavior data and leaning curve
Behavioral results were similar to those obtained by
Wilder et al. [6-9,12,13,18,35-40]. Gain-loss frequency
rather than final outcome dominated subjects' behavior.
Behavioral data confirmed the observations obtained by
Lin and Chiu et al. [6,7] in which subjects preferred bad
final outcome deck B of higher-frequency gain to the
other three decks (see Additional file 1). Moreover, the
learning curve indicated that the deck B was relatively
more attractive than the other three decks throughout the
game (see Additional file 2).
Brain activation during anticipation and experience
This experiment result demonstrated that IN and LN
rather than MPFC was correlated with decision processing, particularly during the anticipation period. This
observation supported the hypothesis based on gain-loss
frequency. In the original IGT (under the uncertainty
game), brain activation during anticipation differed markedly from that during experience (Figure 1). Bilateral IN,
LN, right superior temporal gyrus (STG), left inferior parietal lobule (IPL), and ACC were activated during the
phase of anticipatory feeling and guide decisions (Table
2). Conversely, the other brain loops related to the experience of monetary outcome encompassed the right IPL

phase varied more than those for anticipation.
Brain activation of gain, draw and loss
The respective activation during anticipation and experience of conditions of gain, draw and loss events was analyzed further. The data showed that the brain activations
of gain, draw and loss during anticipation and decision

processing overlapped considerably, including middle
temporal gyrus (MTG), IN, LN (Figure 2).
On the other hand, brain activations of gain, draw and
loss following outcome appearance (experience) segregated respectively into different regions, mainly located in
the posterior part of the brain. The Precuneus, posterior
IN and posterior MTG were engaged in the experience
phase. Furthermore, the lateral part of the IPL and left

Brain activation of decks (A, B, C, D)
During the anticipatory phase, activation was mostly
found in MTG, caudate nucleus (CN), IN, and thalamus
across, although not in all, the four desks. The respective
brain activation map for each deck overlapped substantially during the anticipatory phase. IN engagement was
the only structure identified to be consistent with the originally proposed main loops of SMH (Figure 3).

During the experience phase, diverse patterns for the four
decks were revealed. The MFG and IPL showed common
activation to the outcomes of all decks. The left Precuneus
and the right IPL were activated only during the experience phases of deck A and B (a relatively large gain-loss
and bad long-term outcome). The CN tail was activated by
the deck A, C, and D, but not by B (Figure 3). The left Precuneus was engaged only by deck B.
Time courses of regional activity for 11 monetary values ($
+100, $ + 50, , $ – 350, $ -1150)
The time courses of brain activity for each monetary value
as extracted from significantly activated regions (identified from the anticipation- and experience-related maps; 5
from the former and 1 from the latter) were depicted
using a peri-stimulus time histogram (PSTH; a default
function of SPM2) (Table 2 &3; Figure 4). The activities of
most involved regions didn't follow the monetary
amount, except for differential responses observed in the
right LN and left STG during the anticipation period (Figure 4). MPFC activation was only discovered during the
outcome period of $ -1150, which is the largest loss in IGT
(Figure 5).

The red regions (clusters) denoted the brain activation during the anticipation period. The result indicated that the bilateral striatum, insular cortex, superior temporal gyrus and left
anterior cingulate cortex were significantly activated (Random Effect: Puncorrected = 0.0001, K = 30). During the anticipation period (regions mark in red), the insular cortex and
basal forebrain rather than the medial prefrontal cortex
dominated the generation of subjective feeling and guided the
decision-making. On the other hand, during the experience
period (regions mark in green), the inferior parietal lobule,
superior frontal gyrus and middle frontal gyrus were involved
in the consequence assessment of monetary decision (Random Effect: Puncorrected = 0.0001, K = 30). The thresholds were
adjusted for visualization and discussion purpose.

MFG were involved during the outcome phase (experience) [43]. Bilateral MTG were also commonly activated
in the three conditions, supporting the fact that the activation of value change is correlated with the bar alteration
on the screen (see computer version of IGT [14]).

Discussion
The "prominent deck B phenomenon"
The perseverated behavior of "prominent deck B phenomenon" was confirmed as previously reported [6-9,12,13]
albeit that the effect was sub-significant in our current
study (see Additional file 1 and 2). This result corroborated many IGT-related studies that reported that subjects
actually preferred bad final-outcome deck B of high-frequency gain over good final-outcome decks C or D
[6,8,9,13,18,22,35-40,44,45]. Even Sevy et al., Johnson et
al. and Bechara [46,47] also demonstrated the same
"prominent deck B phenomenon" which was at odds with
their first report [48]. This phenomenon astonishingly
contradicts the basic assumption of IGT which posits that
normal decision makers are prone to avoid the bad deck.
In fact, increasing number of studies consistently showed
that participants preferred decks B and D to decks A and C
[9,13,18,35-40,44,45]. The reason that the earlier studies
failed to demonstrate such phenomenon is that most
studies summed the chosen numbers of deck A and B or
C and D ad hoc, respectively, for inference on the bad vs.
good decks. Notwithstanding, most IGT brain-imaging

studies did not report in details the subjects' behavioral
data in regards to the preference to four-decks neither.

Brain activation for anticipation and experience
In the current study, the IN and LN were strongly associated with events of uncertain situation. The observation
does not completely support the basic assumption of the
IGT or SMH neural loops [14] which did not posits that
LN participates in the anticipation of uncertainty (Figure
1). The conjoined activation of these two structures might
reflect that positive and negative emotions were simultaneously invoked [53] by this uncertain monetary game,
which led to a higher arousal state [54-56]. The arousal
might catalyze the subject into a self-sustained situation
where better psychosomatic condition can be tuned to
augment the explorative intent when confronted with a
challenge of uncertainty, which in turn can be indispensable for the survival of an organism. Numerous studies
have demonstrated that activation of LN is correlated with
the "expectation" of reward [33,56-62] and habit learning
[41,63] while IN have been reported to be engaged in
most studies on visceral and aversive disposition [64-69].
LN can be critical in attributing the positive emotion of
anticipation [70,71] and motivation, i.e., driving force
[34,61]. On the other hand, IN is not only frequently
associated with generation of aversive sensation, e.g., disgust as induced by the repugnant stimuli [67,68], but also
related to the fear [72] and addition behavior preservation
[73]. The engagement of LN, a neural substrate important

A few studies out of over one hundred using the similar
four-deck format and addressing the chosen frequency
had consistently demonstrated that the high-frequency
gain decks B and D were preferentially selected than decks
A and C in the control group [6,8,9,13,18,22,3540,44,45]. The "prominent deck B phenomenon" indicated that subjects were overwhelmed by the high-frequency gain of decks B, D, and also C (as opposed to A, C
has many standoffs in net value within a trial, see also
Chiu et al. [7]) and prohibited by the high-frequency loss
of deck A. Nevertheless, it still stands that subjects prefer
the good final outcome decks (summation of decks C and
D) to the bad final outcome decks (summation of deck A
and B) albeit the fact that the subjects may actually be
implicitly guided by gain-loss frequency instead of longterm outcome [6]. Such interpretation may contradict the
SMH reasoning, however, the gain-loss preponderated
choice behavior is not uncommon in the literature on
decision making, suggesting that decision makers are
often myopic to long-term outcomes [49-51], even under
situations of relative certainty [52].

during the anticipation stage. The bottom lower figure indicated that different monetary consequences activated different brain regions for different outcomes (Random Effect:

for probability learning [41,74] echoes the behavioral
results as compelled by the gain-loss frequency.
Following the appearance of outcomes, the activity of LN
and IN (limbic structures), subsided and the overall activation pattern eminently changed. The circuitries involve
only neocortical areas, mainly encompassing the frontalparietal network (IPC, MFG, and SFG) for processing
value representation and logic inspection. The differential
segregation of brain representation in respect to driving
force and experience sentiments during anticipation and
experience [61] (Figure 1) might attest to two systems,
e.g., wanting and liking systems [55,75] to further the elucidation of neural correlates of decision making and the
accompanied interoceptive feeling.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2202/9/72

Brain activation for gain, loss and draw conditions
Echoing the behavioral result where the subjects' choices
were implicitly biased by high-frequency gain and not
hunched by the long-term outcome, the almost common
activation pattern in general (Figure 2) during the anticipation phase could not decipher or predict the eventual
outcome of gain, loss, or draw conditions. LN, IN, thalamus and MTG were commonly involved in the anticipation phase of three conditions [61]. However, the
overlapped activation patterns diverged into differential
expressions during experience period. The patterns collectively engaged primary visual cortex (V1), bilateral IPC,
SFG, posterior IN and CN [61] where different combinations of neural substrates were noted for respective condition. The result implies that the organism may entail
subcortical/limbic system rather than logic system (neocortex) to deal with the uncertain situation. On the other
hand, after the gain, loss and draws were clearly presented
to subjects, the logic system (neo-cortex) was recruited to
process these consequences. Our results were inconsistent
with cardinal propositions of SMH that posits the MPFC
crucial in generating the "guts" feeling and biasing the
decision during anticipation (the "hunch" processing in
Damasio's term).
Brain activation for decks
Anticipation commonly activated bilateral CN and anterior IN despite some subtle differences in the activated
foci. This was consistent with the previous findings
according to gain, loss and draw condition (see Figure 2)
preconceived with reward-punishment expectation. The
basal forebrain activation (CN in our study) was engaged
commonly across the four decks and suggested a cognitive
component of probability processing or habit establishment during the task performance. MTG activation may
be related to eye scanning among the four decks while the
activation of postcentral gyrus (S1) and precentral gyrus
(M1) could be attributed to joystick operation. Our findings disagreed with the prediction of SMH that the MPFC,
amygdala, IN and S1 subserve primarily the processing of
somatic signal for decision.

V1, IPL and SFG were commonly activated during the
experience period in addition to other discrete regions
under different deck categories. The neo-cortices (frontalparietal circuitries) were targeted for information processing related to outcome. The IGT is extremely complex and
is designed to prevent a subject using the logic reasoning
to find out the long-term benefit. The IGT suggests that
uncertainty can foster the somatic marker (emotion) system to harbor decision makers in reaching the foresighted
(rational) status based on long-term processing. This view
is contentious and may be inconsistent with the numerous studies of "emotion", a phenomenon considered irrational, uncontrollable, and immediate [76,77]. The

The left S1/M1 is more active before choice than the right S1/M1, possibly related to the right hand movement and joystick control.

point a possible need for a reconsideration of neuro-physiological and neuropsychological assumptions of SMH.
The role of medial prefrontal cortex in IGT
Damasio [4] stated that "... the brains of the normal subjects
were gradually learning to predict a bad outcome, and were signaling the relative badness of the particular deck before the
actual card-turning." (Damasio, 1994, p. 220). Damasio et
al. [1-3,48] suggested that the medial prefrontal cortex
(MPFC) plays an important role in integrating bodily signals (Somatic Marker), which provide emotional representation of different external events. Normal decision
makers with intact MPFC should be able to integrate the
bodily signals implicitly and automatically make advantageous real-life decisions. This is of particular importance

under the circumstance in face of uncertain events that
cannot be logically inferred. Based on the findings of galvanic skin conductance studies of SMH, it is conceivable
that the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) should be more
activated before selecting the bad decks A or B, namely the
anticipation period.
However, the current study did not observe any significant
activation under these conditions. Only in the experience
period of the largest loss ($ -1150) of desk B that the
MPFC was expressed (Figure 5). The MPFC function may
contribute to the immediate and shortsighted view as
related to error detection [79-87]. The results of this study
imply that MPFC may play a critical role in error monitoring or conflict detection [79,88-91], but might not solic-

itly play a role in the integration of somatic markers
(bodily responses) and guiding decisions rationally in the
long-run. Further studies are needed to exam this speculation since the results cannot discern the different statistical power calculated from different numbers of trials for
each monetary value. For example, the "$ 100 and $ 50"
comprised over 70% of trials, but "$ -1150" comprised
only 1–3% for each (subject) run. This problem is inherent with the IGT design.
Notably, the right IN manifested the greatest BOLD signal
response during the standoff condition. We speculated
that the IN may be related to the calibration of mental
account or emotion state. On the other hand, right LN
corresponded to the hierarchical change of gain, and not
to loss in IGT (Figure 4, more activity in NT$ 5000, NT$
2500 and see Additional file 3) in face of uncertainty. This
observation similar to many studies on risk of relative certainty [32-34,57-62,92,93] and is congruent with the view
that basal ganglion is related to biological reward system.

This study aimed to disclose neural correlates involved in
decision-making processing during anticipation and experience period of the IGT. There are several points that
mandate more comprehensive studies for clarification in
the future. For example, testing of final-outcome, gainloss frequency, and prominent deck B phenomenon at the
behavioral level reveal only sub-significance. The limited
findings of behavioral data may result from the internal
variation of IGT and emotions interfering with the performance of the MR-scanning procedure. Whether there
exits gender difference of brain activation patterns is of
pertinent interest. For instance, Bolla et al. reported a gender difference in the activity of OFC and DLPFC during
IGT using a gender-balanced approach [94]. Nevertheless,
regions such as the basal ganglia [95] and parietal cortex
[31,32], suggested to be involved in reward-based probability learning [41,74] under uncertainty, was not emphasized by Bolla et al. study. On the other hand, the negative
finding of the ventro-orbital MPFC in this study could
possibly be attributed to the susceptibility signal loss of
fMRI acquisition.
Our behavioral and imaging findings differed from previous IGT-fMRI studies. Caroselli et al. [35] investigated a
large population (seventy-one male, sixty-three female)
demonstrated also the "prominent deck B phenomenon"
and absence of learning curve. A careful review of IGTfMRI studies disclosed that only Northoff et al. [29] presented detailed behavioral data for a four-deck format and
demonstrated the "prominent deck B phenomenon".
Albeit the discrepancy in the behavioral data with original
IGT, the MPFC was found to be activated. The IGT-fMRI
study by Fukui et al. presented behavioral data for the IGT

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2202/9/72

with a two-deck format [25] and perfectly replicated the
original findings as reported by the Iowa group's study in
1994 [48]. However, Fukui et al. behavioral data contradicted with a recent study by Sevy et al., and Johnson et al.,
and Bechara on the "prominent deck B phenomenon"
[46,47]. Tanabe et al. utilized a modified IGT, not original
IGT [96], and focused on the functional discrepancies of
the ventral MPFC between substance users and a control
group. These studies mainly focused on brain activity
changes of the MPFC and OFC in either good-bad or riskysafe conditions (two deck format) without discussion on
the basal ganglia and parietal cortex in decision-making
processing. Notwithstanding, no information was tailored to the "prominent deck B phenomenon". Recently,
Chiu et al. [97] used a modified IGT, namely the Soochow
Gambling Task (SGT) which possess a relative simple and
balanced gain-loss structure than IGT, but keeps all uncertain characteristics of IGT. The experiment result of SGT
clearly demonstrated that decision makers' choice was
dominated by the gain-loss frequency rather than finaloutcome. The heterogeneity of the experimental paradigms and discrepancies of the resulting behavioral data
as well as the different approaches for fMRI data analysis
command a need to further profound and comprehensive
studies for an empirical account for the SMH theory and
MPFC function. All the existing behavioral and brain
imaging literature actually pinpointed that IGT can be not
that optimal to validate the SMH. Therefore, the VMPFC
engagements by the IGT remain elusive and mandate a
further clarification.

Conclusion
Our data indicated that both LN [41,56] and IN [68,98]
can be targeted for decision-making during anticipation
of decision-making under uncertainty. IPL and SFG could
be involved in the appreciation of the consequences of
choices. Common brain processing might occur during
the anticipation periods of gain, loss and draw conditions,
but the varied outcomes may predispose different neural
substrates for the various experiential dimensions. A similar transition also occurred in the four-deck conditions.
The MPFC was founded to be activated only during the
experience period of the largest loss of deck B, but not during anticipation period. The original proposition of SMH
that MPFC should be implicitly engaged under ambivalence to monitor and inhibit the selection of the bad finaloutcome deck by the decision makers is not supported by
the current study. This study suggests that under the confrontation of uncertainty the normal decision makers can
become myopic. LN and IN might play more vital role in
generating the "feeling" accompanying anticipation
which in turn can drive for final decision while MPFC may
serves more the function of online monitoring and error
detection. Consequently, the involvement of consciousness in guiding the decision will be very important in

Figure 6 version of IGT and event-related fMRI design
Computer
Computer version of IGT and event-related fMRI design. Participants were free to consider which deck they wished to
choose. The anticipation period encompassed 6 seconds prior to the button press (0 second) for fMRI data. The experience
period started from button press. The timing of each selection was jittered by subject's free contemplation. Each subject's
time-specific selection pattern was used to model the fMRI signal. After the button-press, the computer displayed the monetary value of gain, loss, or draw via changes in the top bar. The computer displayed the consequences of choices for 8 seconds,
during which the participants were unable to press the button.

understanding the mechanism of covert (emotion) –
overt (rational) coupling [99].

Methods
Subjects
Twenty-four college and graduate school students, 19 to
32 years old (Mean age = 21.0 years old; SD = 3.1; 8 males,
16 females) participated in this study. They had not
played the IGT before. Written informed consent was
obtained from each subject prior to the experiment. Prior
to the experiment, each subject gave informed consent to
the experimental protocol, which had been approved by
the Institutional Ethics Committee of Taipei Veterans
General Hospital. The experiment was conducted in
accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.
Paradigms
Each subject was asked to play a computerized four-deck
IGT game according to the original design [48]. Subjects
were asked to turn a card from the 4-decks voluntarily.
The inside of the card was either in black or red, which was

unrelated to gain or loss. The subjects were instructed to
maximize gains and minimize losses when playing the
game. The IGT contained four decks. Decks A and B had
potentially large immediate gains ($ 100) and losses ($ 50 to $ -1150) in each trial and a disadvantageous finaloutcome ($ -250) from the average of ten trials. Decks C
and D had small immediate gain ($ 50) and loss ($ -25 to
$ -200) and an advantageous final-outcome ($ 250) (for
detailed gain-loss structure and instructions for IGT,
please refer to the references [48,100,101]). Subjects did
not know the internal IGT structure of gain and loss. The
game ended with a total of 100 trials. Different card-display arrangement (ABCD, BCDA ...etc.) for each subject
was implemented to counterbalance the card position
effect and possible confound of eye movement. Subjects
were instructed to play the game using real monetary
value (New Taiwan dollar, NT) and were rewarded with
their final winnings (divided by 1000). For example, a
subject with an account balance of NT 320,000 at the end
of the game was rewarded with 320 NT dollars (~US$ 10).
The time interval of 6 seconds preceding the button press

BMC Neuroscience 2008, 9:72

was defined as anticipation period and the interval after
was defined as experience period (see Figure 6 and legend
for details).
Subjects conducted a short practice version of IGT for
familiarization (with different internal structure of gain
and loss) before actual scanning and during the tri-pilot
scanning inside the MRI-scanner. The fMRI inter-trial
interval was set to be longer than 10 seconds to increase
the sensitivity of event-related design [101]. Subjects were
free to select the card without time constraint. To avoid
the MRI-signal inhomogeneity and the inter-session confounds, the experiment was devoid of 9 interruptions as
the original IGT game where the subjects were asked two
questions after each 10 trials [8,102-104]. Subjects used a
joystick with a press-button for card selection. All subjects
completed the fMRI-experiment in less than 1 hour. The
structural and anatomical images were acquired after a 15
minute break outside the scanner.
fMRI data acquisition
Images were acquired using a 3.0 T Bruker MedSpec S300
system MRI (Kalsrube, Germany) with a quadrature head
coil. The subjects' heads were immobilized with a vacuum-beam pad in the scanner. Functional data were
acquired with a T2*-weighted gradient-echo EPI using
BOLD contrast (TR/TE/θ = 2000 ms/50 ms/90°, slice
thickness = 5 mm, interslice interval = 1 mm, Field of view
(FOV) = 230 × 230 mm2, 64 × 64 × 20 matrix, whole brain
coverage). The first five images (dummy images) of each
session were discarded from the analysis to eliminate possible non-equilibrium effects of magnetization. The anatomical image was acquired using a high-resolution T1weighted, 3D gradient-echo pulse sequence modified
driven equilibrium Fourier transform (MDEFT); TR/TE/TI
= 88.1 ms/4.12 ms/650 ms, slice thickness = 1.5 mm, 256
× 256 × 128 matrix, FOV = 230 × 230 mm2.
Data processing and analysis
The computer version of IGT (programmed with Matlab
6.5) was used to register the behavioral profiles and decision time-points. Image and statistical analyses were processed with SPM2 (Welcome Department of Cognitive
Neurology, London, UK) and displayed using xjView 4.0
(Human Neuroimaging Lab, Baylor College of Medicine,
Houston, TX, U.S.A). Scans were realigned, coregistered,
normalized, time corrected and spatially smoothed with a
4 mm full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) Gaussian
kernel using standard SPM methods. Because of the free
choice and event related design, each subject performed
100 events (choices) in total and the scan (image) number
ranged from 547 to 652 (scans). General Linear Model
(GLM) was first used to model the event-time course for
each subject. Regional differences were statistically thresholded at corrected (family-wise error correction) PFWE-Corr

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2202/9/72

= 0.05, voxel extent (K) = 30 in within-subject analysis. A
random-effect model was applied for the final secondlevel (between-subject) analysis (Puncorrected = 0.0001, K =
30). Coordinates of Z(T)-maxima were registered in
Talairach and Tournoux's 3-D brain stereotaxic system
under MNI template in the SPM [105]. The images were
displayed in neurological convention (the left hemisphere
in the image is the left hemisphere of subject).
We shifted forward the hemodynamic response function
(hrf) by 6 seconds (3 scans) as indexed to the button press
and the epoch ("hrf (with time derivative)" in SPM) was
modeled as pre-choice event for anticipatory phase. The
epoch backward ("hrf (with time derivative)" in SPM) as
indexed to the button press was modeled as post-choice
event for experience phase. The experimental designs for
the four types of comparisons were listed below: 1) total
events: anticipation- and outcome-related brain activation
across all subjects; 2) gain-loss status: gain, draw, and lossrelated brain activation across all subjects; 3) deck category:
A, B, C, and D-deck related brain activation across all subjects;
4) time course of brain activity according to monetary
value in NT$ (US$): 5000(100), 2500(50), 1250(25), 0, 1250(-25), -2500(-50), -5000(-100), -7500(-150), 10000(-200), -12500(-250), -57500(-1150). Cerebral
activity corresponding to each monetary value was
extracted from the mostly-activated voxel out of regions
identified in brain activation maps from 1). Activity readouts from trials of the same monetary value (not same
amount of trials across all monetary values) in each individual were first averaged respectively and then averaged
across 24 individuals (a few conditions were averaged
with a relatively small number of subjects). Brain activity
maps for respective anticipatory and experience phases of
each monetary value across 24 subjects were also
obtained. For brevity and discussion purpose, we particularly focused and presented the findings on the MPFC, i.e.,
medial prefrontal cortex.
According to the original design of IGT, the IGT is highly
uncertain in comparison to other gambles. Each subject's
choice pattern is very different from those of other subjects because subjects possess variant choice numbers and
schedules for specific event (e.g., -1150). The time point
of a specific event was retrieved from behavioral data to
register the brain signal of a specific event. xjView 4.0 was
exploited for the result display.

Most subjects seem prefer to choose deck B which is consistent with the
observation in some researches which demonstrated their IGT data in a
clear "four-deck format". Here we provided a repeated measurement
ANOVA for two variables (expected value: bad (A, B) vs. good (C, D);
gain-loss frequency: high-frequency gain (B, D) vs. Low-frequency gains
(A, C)) were listed as below table. The result indicated there is non-significant effect in the testing.

The learning curve of five blocks in each 20 trials showed that subjects
gradually chose the deck B and avoid deck A, but there have no obviously
ascending pattern for decks C and D in the IGT. The present result may
be inconsistent with the original finding of IGT, but might be congruent
with most IGT related studies which did not show the learning curve of
each deck (most of them use the combination of good decks or bad decks).
The repeated measurement ANOVA for three variables (expected value:
bad (A, B) vs. good (C, D), gain-loss frequency: high-frequency gain (B,
D) vs. Low-frequency gains (A, C), and block (1–5)) was provided here.
The result indicated there is a significant effect on block testing.
